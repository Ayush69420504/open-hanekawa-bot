This is the open source public release of Hanekawa-san, my discord bot.

The original code is closed off in a private repo, and is basically my archive

Version : 1.0
Release Date: 1/11/23

external-libraries.txt contains a repo of binaries that will be required

requirements.txt will have all the needed libraries in this code

defaults.json contains default definitions of embeds and other quirks that
are used in the program.

How to run:

1. Save your bot token in the token file in auth folder
2. Choose a method of encryption, by default it has no encryption
3. Different types of encryption are defined in utils/decryptor.py
4. Their usage is explained in a comment in main.py at the last lines

This is not perfect, i intend to make it fully customizable with more options.

Note: Hanekawa-san.service is a systemd service file that manages starting of discord bot on boot time

Note: Message replies are hard coded in a speech manner resembling Hanekawa Tsubasa chan
a side character in the monogatari series and light novels by nisio isin

Note: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmMcE3SZZlY see this video to understand her character

My request: Watch the Monogatari series :) It looks ecchi but the monolouges
and story is very good. Source : Trust me bro.
