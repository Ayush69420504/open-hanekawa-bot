Not really, I am a bot built by Ayush Karmakar#5015.
My text patterns are inspired by Hanekawa-san from the Monogatari series.
I may not know everything, but i know what i know.
And I am glad to help you with my varied functions.
Syntax: !ara <command> <data, data, ...> //data is seperated by spaces.
